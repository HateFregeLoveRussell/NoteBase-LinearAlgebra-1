#### Description:
With the definitions laid out in [[Systems of Linear Equations|Systems of Linear Equations]] we can investigate problems which are of interest in the theory of Systems of Linear Equations. 

- Determine if a given system is [[Systems of Linear Equations#Definition (Solution to a System of Linear Equations)|Compatible or Incompatible]] 
- Determine if a compatible system is [[Systems of Linear Equations#Definition (Solution to a System of Linear Equations)|determinant]] 
- Find the unique solution of a compatible, determinant system
- Describe the set of all [[Systems of Linear Equations#Definition (Solution to a System of Linear Equations)|solutions]] for a compatible, indeterminant system.

The basic mathematical tool used to answer such questions is called the **==Theory of Determinants==**(See [[Determinants|here]]).
